Rules of MutantVM ship battle:<BR>
-MutantVM is a clien-side opensource program, ofcourse it is possible to  cheat easily, 
but I ask you kindly not to do it. as Richard Dawkins said in one of his books:
"You can turn over the chess table and declare you won, but you will not have won at chess"
-Each ship gets 1% energy per cycle<BR>
-Cannot fire with shields up<BR>
-When hit with shields down there is a 50% posibility of the ship being destroyed<BR>
-When hit with shields up energy is drained by 20%
-When a program reaches the end, it automatically loops to the beginning, callstack is cleared
-you shoul only use variables under this.namespace, for example:
this.namespace.J=50;//this is valid
this.angle=180;//this is cheating
-Using eval could constitute cheating, because more than one command can be executed at once
-You should not directly read/write variables of another ship
<BR>
The MutantVM language:
-it is a hybrid of BASIC and JavaScript
-every line must end with a semicolon, this is the way the VM knows how to execute one statement
-you may not use JavaScript's functions, for() loops while loops, etc. instead of that
you shall use BASIC's FOR loops GOTOs and GOSUBs, RETURNs
-all single statemets will be evaluated in javascript 
Commands:<BR>
-SCAN_QUADRANT();
//sets namespace.found to true if other ship is in quadrant, false if not
//if a ship is found this.namespace.othership_x this.namespace.othership_y this.namespace.othership_speed this.namespace.othership_angle are set
takes 0.0005% of energy
-FIRE();//fires on last ship found on scan, you cannoy fire while shields are up<BR>
Every shot takes 10% of energy,does 20% damage to the  other ship's power supply,if shields are up, if shields are down, it will have a 50% possibility of destroying the ship<BR>
-TURN_RIGHT(degrees);//turns clockwise
takes 0.0001% of energy per degree
-TURN_LEFT(degrees);//turns couter clockwise
takes 0.0001% of energy per degree
-FOWARD_THRUSTERS();//accelerate
takes 0.0005% of energy per unit of speed
-FULL_STOP();//halt
takes 0.0005% energy
-SHIELDS_UP();//route energy to shields
takes 0.1% of energy per cycle to keep the shields up
-SHIELDS_DOWN();//disengage shields
free
-CLOAK();//cannot be detected in quadrant scans
takes 0.5% energy per cycle
-UNCLOAK();
free
-HAIL();//sets namespace.other_ship_team to the name of the other ship, set to "NO ANSWER" is hail was not answered
takes 0.0001% of energy
(hint: you probably don't want to fire on ships that are part of your team)
-ANSWER_HAILS();//enables hail answeres
free
-NO_HAILS();//will return "NO ANSWER" to other ships hailing
free
CHARGE_TORPEADO(percent);//routes power from your ship energy supply to photon torpeado, the parameter will drain power from your ship and put it in the torpeado
FIRE_TORPEADO();//will disable the shields of every ship in the quadrant for 100 cycles, if you fire your torpeado before the charge is 100% it will destroy your ship
BASIC commands
labelname:;//declares a label
example:
myLabel:;

GOTO labelname;//changes the instuction pointer to the line number of the label given
example:
GOTO myLabel;

GOSUB myLabel; RETURN;//goes down to a subrutine until it encounters the RETURN statement
example:
GOSUB SubroutineB;
GOSUB SubroutineA;
GOTO end;
SubroutineA:;
alert("Hey kids, Im in Subroutine A");
RETURN;
SubroutineB:;
alert("Hey kids, Im in Subroutine B");
RETURN;
end:;
output:
Hey kids, Im in Subroutine B
Hey kids, Im in Subroutine A

this.namespace.CONDITION=expression;//sets the condition for the following IF_CONDUTION_TRUE statement
IF_CONDUTION_TRUE THEN label;//goes to label if variable is not 0
example:
this.namespace.CONDITION=this.y>surf2.height/2;//this will be true is the ship is in the lower half of the space
IF_CONDITION_TRUE THEN lblTRUE;//goes to label if this.namespace.CONDITION is true
//this part of the program is reached if the condition was not true
alert("ship is in upper part of space");
GOTO end;
lblTRUE:;
alert("ship is in lower part of space");
end:;

FOR varname = start TO end;//starts a FOR-NEXT loop(nested for loops are also possible)
example
FOR X = 1 to 10;
alert(this.namepsace.X);//will display 1 to 10
NEXT X;

variables:
this.namespace.team_name//this variable can be changed, so youc an camofladge as a member of another team
this.namespace.ship_color
Dont change these variables
this.cycles//stores the number of cycles this ship has gone thru
this.team_real_name//this variable should not be changed
this.x
this.y
this.angle


energy balls
